# Recipe Decider (official name tbd)

## **Idea:**
* Build a website that helps users put together a dish with the ingredients they currently have. A user inputs a few main ingredients (ex. eggs, spam, rice, macaroni, a head of cabbage, can of tuna, egg-o’s) they have and the website will use an API to suggest the best recipes for the given input (fried rice, pasta salad, a sandwich). In this case, the “best” recipes are easy recipes where the user have all/majority of the ingredients.


## **Roles:**
* Two on backend (Maggie Tsang and Alaina Kwan) 
    * Interact with the API(s) to get the desired recipe
    * Design the algorithm to return the most relevant recipes 
    * Search bar
* Two on frontend (Abby Huang and Eshin Ang) 
    * One working on the desktop UI
    * One working on the mobile UI
    * When both are finished, add more filtering features after searching for  recipe (cuisine, allergies, diet restrictions)


## **Frameworks/Libraries**
* [Recipe API](https://developer.yummly.com/documentation) 
* Bootstrap
* (Extra feature to save recipes) Firebase
